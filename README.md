flextile
========

While markdown and textile are really good markup generators I found extending them to be somewhat daunting. I did not want to dabble in regexes when trying to add features like:

- Automatic numbering of elements such as chapters and sections
- Automatic building of lists of elements such as figures, links, footnotes etc. 
- Extending the list of basic commands easily
